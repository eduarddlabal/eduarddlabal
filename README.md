all my projects are now available at: https://git.edcs.cz

Hello, I'm an electrical engineering student from Czechia. Mostly, I'm a hobbyist who loves to play with many different things - from microcontrollers and Linux to network devices.

Currently, I'm trying to improve myself with C++ and learning to program ST controllers. I also have some experience with Autodesk software, like AutoCAD and Revit.
