## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹
I am an electrical engineering student. I code in C/C++ and Python, specializing in microcontroller programming. I am also an enthusiast of Linux, computer networks, and cybersecurity. In connection with this, I am building my own home lab with several servers and learning to work with Mikrotik network devices.
